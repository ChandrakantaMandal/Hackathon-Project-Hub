## Development

### Scripts

Client
- npm run dev — Vite dev server
- npm run build — production build
- npm run preview — preview the build

Server
- npm run dev — start with nodemon
- npm start — start API

### Useful tips
- The client uses `VITE_API_URL`; when unset it falls back to `http://localhost:5000/api`
- `CORS_ORIGINS` supports comma-separated origins for local multi-port setups
- Projects use `title` (not `name`); keep naming consistent in the UI
- Email verification codes expire after 10 minutes
- Temporary registrations are stored in-memory and cleared after 10 minutes
- Rate limiting: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Production builds automatically remove console.logs

### Performance Tips
- **Code Splitting**: Vendor libraries are split into separate chunks for better caching
- **Lazy Loading**: Images use `loading="lazy"` attribute
- **Memoization**: Components use `React.memo()`, `useMemo()`, and `useCallback()`
- **Database Indexes**: All models have optimized indexes for faster queries
- **Compression**: Gzip compression reduces response sizes by 70-90%
- **Build Optimization**: Terser minification and tree-shaking in production

### Troubleshooting

**Authentication Issues**
- `401 Unauthorized`: Token missing/expired; sign in again
- `Email verification failed`: Check if OTP is correct and not expired (10 min)
- `User already exists`: Email is already registered; try logging in

**Connection Issues**
- `CORS error`: Verify `CORS_ORIGINS` in server `.env` matches client URL
- `Network error`: Check if backend is running on correct port
- `MongoDB connection error`: Verify `MONGODB_URI` and ensure MongoDB is running

**Email Issues**
- `Error sending verification email`: Check `MAILTRAP_TOKEN` is valid
- `Mailtrap ENOTFOUND`: Verify internet connection and Mailtrap service status

**Build/Dev Issues**
- “Completed” count is 0: a project is completed only when status === "completed"
- `Vite port in use`: Change dev port with `vite --port 5174`
- `Module not found`: Run `npm install` in both client and server
- `Duplicate index warnings`: Already fixed - indexes optimized

**Data Issues**
- `Completed count is 0`: Project is completed only when `status === "completed"`
- `Tasks not updating`: Check if task status is being saved correctly
- `Leaderboard empty`: Projects must be scored by judges to appear
